## Introduction ##

BloggerCMS is a CMS made in PHP that helps you create truly static blogs via provided admin panel interface; you don't need to create blog posts manually in text files or knowing [Markdown][1] syntax unlike other static site generators which is time-consuming. The created blogs become fully potable without any dependencies such as database or any other complicated setups. All data of the blog gets stored in human readable JSON format. The web-based interface (admin panel) makes it very easy even for beginners to create and manage the blog. 

To deploy your blog, all you need is upload the static blog generated by BloggerCMS to your web host and see it in action. You don't need any server-side language support or database on your hosting provider because everything generated by BloggerCMS is pure HTML. You can also host your blog on [Github][2] (this blog demo runs on github), [Dropbox][3] or any other service you like. The good thing is that you can easily backup your blog too because it's just a folder containing your blog. 

BloggerCMS comes with fully responsive blog template based on famous [Twitter Bootstrap][4] with quite few themes to choose from. You can also create your own blog layouts, all you need to know is HTML and basics of [Mustache][5] template engine.
